# Cse-465-Project-Bangla-Handwriting-Recognition
This is a project for my course CSE465- Pattern Recognition and Neural Network

Dataset- BanglaLekha Isolated ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340917301117). Dataset consists of 166105 images of 84 characters. I used
3000 images of 1st 60 characters since the dataset is huge. 
Project was to apply some CNN architectures. Here, I applied ANN, Simple CNN, Lenet5, Alexnet, ZF net and Vgg16.
